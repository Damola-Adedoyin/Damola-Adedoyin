👋 Hi, I’m `@Damola-Adedoyin`, A data science, data analytics, Machine Learning, and energy conservation enthusiast. Detail-oriented with strong logical thinking, proficient in SQL/PowerBI/Python/Excel, etc. Passionate about making data useful. I appreciate listening to my team's data requirements, being inventive, and turning them into code whose output:
   1. represents effective data collection and analysis methods to meet the project's demands.
   2. helps the team study and work with their data more effectively.
   3. provides the team or stakeholders with practicable insights.
   
With that said;
